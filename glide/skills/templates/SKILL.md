### What to Look For

When exploring a template:

- **Collection styles** - How do they display lists of data? (Table, Card, List, Kanban)
- **Detail screens** - What components show item details? How dense is the layout?
- **Forms** - How is data entry organized? What validations exist?
- **Navigation** - How many tabs? What's in the menu vs navigation?
- **Computed columns** - What calculations or transformations are used?
- **Relationships** - How are tables connected?

## When to Research Templates

**Before building a new app type** - Search for templates in the same category to understand common patterns and user expectations.

**When implementing a specific feature** - Find a template that has that feature and see how it's built.

**During design review** - Compare your screens to professional templates. Are you using the same level of component variety and data density?

**When stuck on layout** - Templates show proven layouts for common scenarios.

## Template Research Workflow

1. **Identify the app type** - What category does your app fit?
2. **Find 2-3 relevant templates** - Look for similar use cases
3. **Copy templates to workspace** - Get full access to explore
4. **Document patterns** - Note useful designs, components, and data structures
5. **Apply learnings** - Use the patterns in your own app

Templates are learning resources - study them to build better apps.
